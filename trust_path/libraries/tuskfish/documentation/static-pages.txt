STATIC PAGES
============
* Static pages are added to (and become searchable in) the database via the standard data entry form.
* Copy the static page template file into your root directory with whatever name you want.
* Manually set the ID of the static content object at the top of the page.
* As with any other page, you can manually override the template and metadata by editing the comments
  in the footer. You can also create a unique block layout etc, should you wish.
