ROUNDTRIPPING THE DATA ENTRY/EDIT FORMS
=======================================
* Issues:
  - On selecting a file (data entry) the file name does not show.
  - Media/image attachments are lost when edit an existing object (data edit). Reselecting them prevents this but is unacceptable.
  - Changing type of object needs to reload the form with all of the fields intact.

* Editing an object:
  - New or old, must load from DB and save with UPDATE.

* ChangedField:
  - New or old (check if ID set), must reload from POST.
  - New save with INSERT.
  - Old save with UPDATE.

BASICALLY
=========
* Data entry form works (the file name not displaying will go away when a better file input control is used).
* Data edit is fine except for the media/image file names getting lost on UPDATE. Need to add a bit of logic.
* Data changedField is not working.
