FINISHING UPLOAD HANDLING
=========================

Remaining issues are:

1. When editing a content object, need to display the *name* (not filepath) of any existing upload
   in the uploader control. Can do this with a simple button, but it seems that the html file input
   control does not allow a predefined value to be assigned for "security reasons".

2. When editing a content object, need a control to delete any existing upload. This could be done
   by a simple checkbox, but it would be nice if the 'delete' button fired a js event that set a
   hidden form field to whack the old upload on submission of the form.

If can do this, the backend of Tuskfish is essentially complete. So the question is essentially
how to populate the upload field of bootstrap-fileinput and wire up the buttons to trigger js
events?

- The 'file caption section' seems to control the view of the file name.
- The 'file actions section' controls the browse/remove/upload buttons.
- The 'file preview section' displays the thumbnail.

All options to the input can be passed as HTML5 data attributes.

Ability to configure the plugin to show an initial preview of images/files with initial caption 
(more useful for record update scenarios). Refer the initialPreview, initialPreviewConfig, and 
initialCaption properties in the plugin options section for configuring this.

Option to show/hide any or all of the following:

* Caption section
* Preview section
* Upload button
* Remove button

With release 2.5.0 you can now control which file types or extensions are allowed for upload by
setting allowedFileTypes and allowedFileExtensions.
