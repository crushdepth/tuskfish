FINISHING UPLOAD HANDLING
=========================

Remaining issues are:

1. When editing a content object, need to display the *name* (not filepath) of any existing upload
   in the uploader control. Can do this with a simple button, but it seems that the html file input
   control does not allow a predefined value to be assigned for "security reasons".

2. When editing a content object, need a control to delete any existing upload. This could be done
   by a simple checkbox, but it would be nice if the 'delete' button fired a js event that set a
   hidden form field to whack the old upload on submission of the form.

If can do this, the backend of Tuskfish is essentially complete. So the question is essentially
how to populate the upload field of bootstrap-fileinput and wire up the buttons to trigger js
events?
