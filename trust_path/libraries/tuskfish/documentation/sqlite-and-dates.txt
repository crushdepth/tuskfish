SQLITE AND DATES
================
TLDR: Need to add a date picker that can store dates in ISO 8601 strings.

SQLite does not have a storage class set aside for storing dates and/or times. Instead, the built-in
Date And Time Functions of SQLite are capable of storing dates and times as TEXT, REAL, or INTEGER 
values:

* TEXT as ISO8601 strings ("YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.SSS").
* REAL as Julian day numbers, the number of days since noon in Greenwich on November 24, 4714 B.C. according to the proleptic Gregorian calendar.
* INTEGER as Unix Time, the number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC.

The corresponding template for the text version in PHP's date() function is:

date('Y-m-d H:i:s', $timestamp);

SQLite allows to use the literal 'T' character to separate the date/time components, so the constant
DATE_ATOM can be used, eg. date(DATE_ATOM, $timestamp);

To sort by date in SQLite:

SELECT *  FROM table ORDER BY date(dateColumn) DESC.

To sort by date and time need to use datetime() instead of date().
