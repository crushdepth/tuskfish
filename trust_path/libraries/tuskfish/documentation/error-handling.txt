ERROR HANDLING POLICY
=====================

Trying to handle errors in a consistent and appropriate manner:

1. User-facing control scripts (via TfishFilter testing): Redirect to a polite error message page and log a notice.
2. Object internal type/validation checks: Soft redirect or hard stop depending on seriousness (security risk or just broken).
3. Database methods: Hard stop and log error, no exceptions.
