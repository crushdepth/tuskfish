Pagination
==========

- Calculate and hold pagination information (core).
- Emit HTML pagination controls (library-specific methods, a bootstrap method will be included
  but people can just add another method if they wish to use a different library).

Properties
- Base URL (used to construct the links, default is current page).
- Object count
  - Easiest way is to pass in the result of selectCount() using same criteria as select();
    Any limit clause will be disregarded during the count.
- Pagination limit (default is to obtain from preference object, but can be overridden).
- Style (implement later), default is page-by-page with next/previous links.
  - An archive page will be developed later on to allow specific time periods to be accessed.
