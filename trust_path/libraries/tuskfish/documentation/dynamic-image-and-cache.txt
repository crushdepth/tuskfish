DYNAMIC IMAGE RESIZING AND CACHE
================================
* Want content objects to be able to dynamically produce variable sized copies of their image and/or media file.
  - Upload a high quality master with the content object.
  - Thumbnails of different sizes can be produced from the master to suit the requirements of different templates or contexts.
  - As image resizing is computationally expensive, the copies should be saved in the /cache with a file name that indicates their size.
  
* Logic is fairly simple:
  - Templates: Objects can be requested to return arbitrary sized thumbnails of their image file.
    - Object first checks the cache to see if a copy exists.
	- If not, object produces a copy for the cache.
	- Either way, URL to cached thumbnail image is returned.

* Main technical issues:
  - What image library/method should be used to resize the image? AFAIK there is not universal standard in PHP.
    - GD is probably close to a standard.
    - Imagemagick is better (imagick?).
  - Where should the method be housed?
    - Content object?
	- Content handler?
	- Image handler?
	- Utility?
	
	$object->cachedImage();
	$handler::cachedImage($object->image);
	
	Probably makes more sense to put it in the object handler. However, it is just a presentation issue really,
	since the end result is just a "get property'. And the syntax is shorter.
