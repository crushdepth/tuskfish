A BETTER DATE PICKER
====================
Three good looking options are:

* DateTimePicker (jQuery plugin)
  - http://xdsoft.net/jqplugins/datetimepicker/
  - UI is a bit ugly but quite utilitarian, access to everything.
  - Not free, but for $15 can integrate into OS project.

* jQM DateBox
  - http://dev.jtsage.com/DateBox/
  - Beautiful UI, but not sure can access date + time together.
  - If want mobile support, need to include jQuery Mobile as well.
  - Building an appropriate package seems annoyingly over-complicated.

* bootstrap-datepicker
  - https://bootstrap-datepicker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
  - Basic but effective UI.

Maybe I'll just keep using the native one in the browser. It's not that bad.
