TEMPLATES
=========
* Theme-level templates can be dynamically assigned to pages by overriding the default.
* Theme-level CSS can (and are) changed on the fly according to theme. This allows control over
  most things but not the *layout* of individual content objects.
* Object-level templates can be dynamically assigned by overriding the default.
* Template rendering can be done generically by the TfishTemplate class, or more specifically by
  using an object-specific template class.
* At present, the template engine can't handle arrays, it only works with string output.
* Template rendering is currently handled by the TfishTemplate object.
* Template concatenation is currently handled by the TfishTemplate object.
* Scenario: Have an array of different kinds of content objects. How to render them all with the
  appropriate templates?
