TEMPLATES
=========
* Theme-level templates can be dynamically assigned to pages by overriding the default.
* Theme-level CSS can (and are) changed on the fly according to theme. This allows control over
  most things but not the *layout* of individual content objects.
* Object-level templates can be dynamically assigned by overriding the default.
* Template rendering can be done generically by the TfishTemplate class, or more specifically by
  using an object-specific template class.
* At present, the template engine can't handle arrays, it only works with string output.
* Template rendering is currently handled by the TfishTemplate object.
* Template concatenation is currently handled by the TfishTemplate object.
* Scenario: Have an array of different kinds of content objects. How to render them all with the
  appropriate templates?

$ouput = '';
foreach ($contentObj as $content) {
	$content_template_handler = new $content->type . 'Template' . ($content);
	$rendered_content = $content_template_handler->render($content);
}

The current template system has two problems:
  - Can't evaluate PHP in a HTML template retrieved with file_get_contents(), as a result of which
  - Can't turn off empty elements and their HTML containers. Maybe it could be done with Javascript, but that is too horrible to think about.

Old Skool - use a combined PHP/HTML template and do not use file_get_contents() (and this is why Smarty templates have logic in them).
  - Keep the template objects and render() function, which will still accept an object for presentation and load the template.
