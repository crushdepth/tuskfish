DEV STATUS
==========
The purpose of this file is so I can keep track of what I was last working on, and what I need to do.

MINIMUM FUNCTIONALITY
=====================
* Robust solution for file uploads (editing, delinking cases). Half day.
* Test PNG and GIF handling and add support for transparency. Half day.
* Minor validation bug in the selection boxes (online?). 20 mins.
* Grey out read-only sections of the form when changing object type. 1 day.
* Front end object templates (with scalable images). 1 day.
* Add an admin-side image gallery script (just needs template, code is already there). 2 hours.
* Write a simple manual providing installation and usage guide, and overview of the architecture
  with examples of how to build controller scripts, templates and work with criteria. 1 week.

Estimated remaining dev time: 3.5 - 4 days, not including the manual.

WHERE I LEFT OFF
================
* Data edit form: How to handle editing of file uploads?
* Add site-wide quality preference for jpeg and png images.
* Implement site closed preference.
* Detail the data entry form
  - Consider using this Bootstrap select box plugin: https://silviomoreto.github.io/bootstrap-select/examples/
  - Data entry form should show/hide fields as relevant when the content type is selected (use AJAX method and bootstrap hide classes).
  - Date and submission time fields - need to have a useful selector added. Maybe submission time can be hidden.

OPTIMISATION / CONSOLIDATION
============================
* Rationalise file paths, especially for templates.
* Final security audit on the code.
  - Check file path constraints.
* Reorder methods so that public/private are paired.

POLISH
======
The following things need to be added to make it attractive to the great unwashed public:
* Shiny AJAXified file uploader.
* Data entry/edit forms improve spacing of elements, especially on folding the layout.
* Teaser block.
* Spotlight block.
* Image block.
* "Module" pages
  - News archive
  - Podcasts
  - Events
  - Galleries
  - Soundtracks / videos (HTML5 player)

THINGS THAT NEED TO CHANGE FOR PRODUCTION CODE
==============================================
* Set UTF-8 as the default charset in php.ini.
* Logger needs echoing of error messages to screen commented out.
* Logger needs to return FALSE otherwise trigger_error() will not stop script execution (in dev mode, it's handy to let the script keep going to get context).
* TfishFilter::connect() needs the error mode PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION changed to silent or warning (stop throwing exceptions!). This could be a preference setting.
* Uncomment the section of the installation script that deletes the installation script.
* Bootstrap-fileinput library needs to have the 'showUpload' button config option set to FALSE to hide the unused upload button. Do this by editing:

$.fn.fileinput.defaults = {
    language: 'en',
    showCaption: true,
    showPreview: true,
    showRemove: true,
    showUpload: false, // <------ just set this from true to false
    showCancel: true,
    showUploadedThumbs: true,
    // many more below
};
