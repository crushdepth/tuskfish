DEV STATUS
==========
The purpose of this file is so I can keep track of what I was last working on, and what I need to do.

WHERE I LEFT OFF
================
* Add site-wide quality preference for jpeg and png images.
* Detail the data entry form
  - Add pagination controls to the default table.
  - Add drop down selectors to filter the table.
  - Consider using this Bootstrap select box plugin: https://silviomoreto.github.io/bootstrap-select/examples/
  - Take the select boxes out of the form (build them in the class files).
  - Data entry form should show/hide fields as relevant when the content type is selected (use AJAX method and bootstrap hide classes).
  - Date and submission time fields - need to have a useful selector added. Maybe submission time can be hidden.
* Data edit form: How to handle editing of file uploads?

THINGS THAT NEED TO CHANGE FOR PRODUCTION CODE
==============================================
* Set UTF-8 as the default charset in php.ini.
* Logger needs echoing of error messages to screen commented out.
* Logger needs to return FALSE otherwise trigger_error() will not stop script execution (in dev mode, it's handy to let the script keep going to get context).
* TfishFilter::connect() needs the error mode PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION changed to silent or warning (stop throwing exceptions!). This could be a preference setting.
* Uncomment the section of the installation script that deletes the installation script.
