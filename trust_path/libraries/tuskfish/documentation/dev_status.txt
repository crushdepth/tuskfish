DEV STATUS
==========
The purpose of this file is so I can keep track of what I was last working on, and what I need to do.

WHERE I LEFT OFF
================
* Detail the data entry form
  - Take the select boxes out of the form (build them in the class files).
  - Data entry form should show/hide fields as relevant when the content type is selected (use AJAX method and bootstrap hide classes).
  - Date and submission time fields - need to have a useful selector added. Maybe submission time can be hidden.
* Create a search function + advanced search page.
* Data edit form: How to handle editing of file uploads?
  - Image/media fields should display the file name of any existing file.
* Consider creating a controller class that can handle the basic add/edit/update/confirm/delete operations and standard views (single, newsfeed, grid).
  1. Listen for whitelisted script parameters
  2. Validate the data (whitelists, type) but leave it to objects internal security to validate in detail.
  3. Define key standard actions:
     - Add
     - Edit
     - Submit
     - Confirm
     - Delete
     - View (index table, single object, multiple objects, grid view).
  4. Issues
     - Parameters would be i) parameter whitelist, ii) action whitelist, iii) templates and forms for admin actions, iv) templates for different views.
     - How to accommodate the logic for different actions? It will vary by page, object etc.

THINGS THAT NEED TO CHANGE FOR PRODUCTION CODE
==============================================
* Set UTF-8 as the default charset in php.ini.
* Logger needs echoing of error messages to screen commented out.
* Logger needs to return FALSE otherwise trigger_error() will not stop script execution (in dev mode, it's handy to let the script keep going to get context).
* TfishFilter::connect() needs the error mode PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION changed to silent or warning (stop throwing exceptions!). This could be a preference setting.
