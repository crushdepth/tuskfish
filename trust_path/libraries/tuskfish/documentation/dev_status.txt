DEV STATUS
==========
The purpose of this file is so I can keep track of what I was last working on, and what I need to do.

WHERE I LEFT OFF
================
* Pagination: Add a preference to set the number of pagination slots.
* Data edit form: How to handle editing of file uploads?
  - Image/media fields should display the file name of any existing file.
* Detail the data entry form
  - Date and submission time fields - need to have a useful selector added. Maybe submission time can be hidden.
  - Data entry form should show/hide fields as relevant when the content type is selected.
* Create a search function.
* Take all the logic out of the forms; build it in the script and just pass in values.
* Consider creating a controller class that can handle the basic add/edit/update/confirm/delete operations and standard views (single, newsfeed, grid).
* Preferences: Add a preference editing script; need to add DB update functionality to the TfishPreference class.

THINGS THAT NEED TO CHANGE FOR PRODUCTION CODE
==============================================
* Set UTF-8 as the default charset in php.ini.
* Logger needs echoing of error messages to screen commented out.
* Logger needs to return FALSE otherwise trigger_error() will not stop script execution (in dev mode, it's handy to let the script keep going to get context).
* TfishFilter::connect() needs the error mode PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION changed to silent or warning (stop throwing exceptions!). This could be a preference setting.
