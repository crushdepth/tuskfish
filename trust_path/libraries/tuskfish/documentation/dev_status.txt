DEV STATUS
==========
The purpose of this file is so I can keep track of what I was last working on, and what I need to do.

MINIMUM FUNCTIONALITY
=====================
* Collection objects - need to pull in some recursive category handling code:
  - Build a category tree select box (for data entry/edit form, to replace 'parent' text box).
    The parent select box also needs to restrict selections to collectoin objects.
  - Find first child.
* Add icon to indicate object type in index / single view.
* Make captions wrap if they are wider than the parent figure.
* Minor validation bug in the selection boxes (online?). 20 mins.
* Add an RSS feed to collection objects, to allow creation of podcasts.
* Add this check to all clases: if (!defined("TFISH_ROOT_PATH")) die("TFISH_ERROR_ROOT_PATH_NOT_DEFINED");

* Review error handling policy: Some fatal triggered errors could be handled as warnings + log;
  other user-side ones eg. in control scripts may be better just to redirect to a polite error
  warning page.
* Review location / path to media/images folder. Have to put video/audio files in web root if
  want to use HTML5 native players; but images could still live in the trust path, and they are
  probably more important.
* Changed CHMOD of uploaded files to 0644; can something more restrictive be used?

= 1 days.

RELEASE FUNCTIONALITY
=====================
* Rationalise file paths etc: Could be handled better, especially templates.
* Add an admin-side image gallery script (just needs template, code is already there). 2 hours.
* Write a simple manual providing installation and usage guide, and overview of the architecture
  with examples of how to build controller scripts, templates and work with criteria. 1 week.

= 1 week.

WHERE I LEFT OFF
================
* Detail the data entry form
  - Consider using this Bootstrap select box plugin: https://silviomoreto.github.io/bootstrap-select/examples/
  - Data entry form should show/hide fields as relevant when the content type is selected (use AJAX method and bootstrap hide classes).
  - Date and submission time fields - need to have a useful selector added. Maybe submission time can be hidden.

OPTIMISATION / CONSOLIDATION
============================
* Rationalise file paths, especially for templates.
* Final security audit on the code.
  - Check file path constraints.
* Reorder methods so that public/private are paired.

POLISH
======
The following things need to be added to make it attractive to the great unwashed public:
* Shiny AJAXified file uploader (have, but add rotational controls as it doesn't like portrait layout).
* Data entry/edit forms improve spacing of elements, especially on folding the layout.
* Teaser block.
* Spotlight block.
* Image block.

THINGS THAT NEED TO CHANGE FOR PRODUCTION CODE
==============================================
* Set UTF-8 as the default charset in php.ini.
* Logger needs echoing of error messages to screen commented out.
* Logger needs to return FALSE otherwise trigger_error() will not stop script execution (in dev mode, it's handy to let the script keep going to get context).
* TfishFilter::connect() needs the error mode PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION changed to silent or warning (stop throwing exceptions!). This could be a preference setting.
* Uncomment the section of the installation script that deletes the installation script.
