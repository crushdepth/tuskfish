<h1>Standard code security audit</h1>
<p>All PHP files *must* be audited against the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Externally supplied data ($_POST, $_GET etc) may only be accepted for processing if it's on
        a whitelist of expected data and range checked as far as possible prior before use.</li>
    <li>Database operations exclusively use prepared statements (PDO) with bound parameters to
        guard against SQL injection. No parameter may be directly included in an SQL statement; all
        parameters are required to be inserted via a bound parameter or bound value.</li>
</ul>
